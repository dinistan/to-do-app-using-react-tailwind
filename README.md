React To-Do App
	Overview
This is a To-Do app created using React and Tailwind CSS, with Vite as the build tool. The app allows users to add, mark as complete/incomplete, and delete tasks. The task list is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions.

Features
Task Input: Users can add new tasks using the input field.
Task List: Tasks are displayed in a list format.
Mark as Complete/Incomplete: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks using the delete (bin) icon.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they are preserved even after closing and reopening the browser.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.
Vite: For fast and optimized development.
