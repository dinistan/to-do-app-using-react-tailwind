## Overview

This is a To-Do app created using React and Tailwind CSS, with Vite as the build tool. The app allows users to add, mark as complete/incomplete, and delete tasks. The task list is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions.

## Features

- **Task Input:** Users can add new tasks using the input field.
- **Task List:** Tasks are displayed in a list format.
- **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:** Clicking on a task toggles its completion status.
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks using the delete (bin) icon.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they are preserved even after closing and reopening the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **Vite:** For fast and optimized development.
